# Engine Development Phases

This file is the source of truth for development order.
Each slice ends with a `git commit`. Do not move to the next slice until the current one
compiles cleanly, runs without validation errors, and the commit is made.

After completing every slice, update the checkbox here and commit the updated PHASES.md
as part of that slice's commit.

**Rules for Claude Code:**
- Complete one slice fully before starting the next.
- Each slice commit message must follow the format: `[PhaseN/SliceM] <description>`.
- Never implement functionality that belongs to a later phase.
- If a slice is blocked, stop and report the blocker — do not skip ahead.
- Run the build and fix all warnings before committing.

## Phase 1 — Foundation & Window

Goal: a window opens, Vulkan initialises, a black frame is presented, the app closes cleanly.

- [x] **1.1 — Repo scaffold**
  Create `CMakeLists.txt`, `vcpkg.json`, directory skeleton (`src/`, `include/`, `assets/`, `cooked/`),
  `.gitignore`, and this `CLAUDE.md` + `PHASES.md` at root.
  *Commit: `[Phase1/Slice1] repo scaffold and build system`*

- [x] **1.2 — SDL3 window + event loop**
  `src/main.cpp` opens an SDL3 window, pumps events, exits cleanly on close/ESC.
  No Vulkan yet.
  *Commit: `[Phase1/Slice2] SDL3 window and event loop`*

- [x] **1.3 — Vulkan device**
  `src/rhi/device.cpp`: instance, debug messenger, physical device selection (prefer discrete),
  logical device, graphics + compute + transfer queues.
  Validation layers enabled in debug builds.
  *Commit: `[Phase1/Slice3] Vulkan device creation`*

- [x] **1.4 — Swapchain + present loop**
  `src/rhi/swapchain.cpp`: swapchain, image views, per-frame sync primitives (2 frames in flight).
  Main loop acquires, submits an empty command buffer, presents. No rendering yet.
  *Commit: `[Phase1/Slice4] swapchain and present loop`*

- [x] **1.5 — VMA + GpuBuffer / GpuImage wrappers**

## Phase 2 — Render Graph & First Triangle

Goal: render graph infrastructure exists; a hard-coded triangle appears on screen via a Slang shader.

- [x] **2.1 — Slang shader compilation pipeline**
  CMake custom command runs `slangc` on all `.slang` files in `assets/shaders/`,
  outputs SPIR-V + reflection JSON to `cooked/shaders/`.
  Add a trivial `passthrough.slang` (fullscreen triangle, outputs solid colour) to verify.
  *Commit: `[Phase2/Slice1] Slang shader compilation pipeline`*

- [x] **2.2 — Pipeline cache + shader module loader**
  `src/rhi/pipeline_cache.cpp`: load SPIR-V, create `VkShaderModule`, cache by path hash.
  Parse reflection JSON to auto-derive push constant ranges and descriptor layouts.
  *Commit: `[Phase2/Slice2] pipeline cache and shader reflection`*

- [x] **2.3 — Descriptor buffer setup**
  Implement descriptor buffer allocation (one buffer per descriptor set layout).
  Helper to write sampler/image/buffer descriptors into the buffer at a given offset.
  *Commit: `[Phase2/Slice3] descriptor buffer infrastructure`*

- [x] **2.4 — Render graph core**
  `src/rhi/render_graph.cpp`: `RenderPass` declaration (reads/writes), topological sort,
  automatic `VkImageMemoryBarrier2` insertion via synchronization2, execution loop.

- [x] **2.5 — First triangle**
  `assets/shaders/mesh.slang`: minimal vertex + fragment shader (hardcoded triangle, UV-based colour).

  Triangle appears on screen.
  *Commit: `[Phase2/Slice5] first triangle via render graph`*

---

- [x] **3.1 — Asset manager skeleton**
  `src/asset/asset_manager.cpp`: `AssetId` (xxHash64 of relative path), `AssetHandle<T>`,
  synchronous load path (async deferred to Phase 6). Default fallback assets.
  *Commit: `[Phase3/Slice1] asset manager skeleton`*

- [x] **3.2 — glTF static mesh loading**
  `src/scene/gltf_loader.cpp` using fastgltf: load positions, normals, UVs, tangents, indices.
  Upload to device-local vertex + index buffers. Store as `MeshAsset`.
  *Commit: `[Phase3/Slice2] glTF static mesh loading`*

- [x] **3.3 — Texture loading**

  *Commit: `[Phase3/Slice4] material asset and Slang material interface`*

- [x] **3.5 — GBuffer pass**
  `assets/shaders/gbuffer.slang` + `src/renderer/mesh_pass.cpp`:
  Deferred GBuffer: albedo (RGB), normal (RG oct-encoded), material (metallic/roughness/AO), depth.
  Render all `MeshRenderer` entities.
  *Commit: `[Phase3/Slice5] deferred GBuffer pass`*

- [x] **3.6 — Lighting pass**
  `assets/shaders/lighting.slang` + `src/renderer/lighting_pass.cpp`:
  Fullscreen compute pass reading GBuffer, applying one directional light, writing HDR colour.
  *Commit: `[Phase3/Slice6] deferred lighting pass`*

- [x] **3.7 — Tonemap + present**
  `assets/shaders/tonemap.slang`: ACES tonemap, gamma correction, write to swapchain image.
  Static glTF mesh now visible with correct lighting.
  *Commit: `[Phase3/Slice7] tonemap pass and lit static mesh`*

---

## Phase 4 — ECS & Scene

Goal: entities with components drive rendering; a scene can be constructed in code.

- [x] **4.1 — ECS world + core components**
  Integrate entt. Define all core components from `components.hpp` (Transform, MeshRenderer,
  Camera, DirectionalLight, Name, Parent, Children).
  *Commit: `[Phase4/Slice1] ECS world and core components`*

- [x] **4.2 — Scene + system scheduler**
  `src/scene/scene.cpp`: owns `entt::registry`, registers and ticks systems in fixed order.
  Systems: `TransformSystem` (propagate world matrices), `RenderCollectSystem` (fill draw list).
  *Commit: `[Phase4/Slice2] scene and system scheduler`*

- [x] **4.3 — Camera system**
  `CameraSystem`: project + view matrix from active `Camera` + `Transform`.
  Push to GPU via per-frame uniform buffer. Update GBuffer + lighting shaders to use it.
  *Commit: `[Phase4/Slice3] camera system and per-frame uniforms`*

- [x] **4.4 — glTF scene graph loading**
  `GltfLoader` now creates entities: nodes → `Transform` + `MeshRenderer`, scene hierarchy → `Parent`/`Children`.
  Load a multi-node glTF scene and render it correctly.
  *Commit: `[Phase4/Slice4] glTF scene graph to ECS`*

- [x] **4.5 — PBR direct lighting**
  Upgrade the deferred lighting compute pass from Lambert to a Cook-Torrance microfacet
  BRDF (GGX NDF, height-correlated Smith visibility, Schlick Fresnel) for the directional
  light. Reconstruct world position from the GBuffer depth + inverse view-proj so the pass
  has the per-pixel view vector; feed it the camera position. Makes the loaded
  metallic/roughness data actually drive shading. IBL/environment ambient deferred to Phase 7/8.
  *Commit: `[Phase4/Slice5] PBR direct lighting`*

---

## Phase 5 — Skeletal Animation

Goal: a glTF character with skin and animations plays back and renders correctly.

  *Commit: `[Phase5/Slice3] animator and joint matrix computation`*

- [x] **5.4 — GPU skinning compute pass**
  `assets/shaders/skinning.slang` + `src/renderer/skinning_pass.cpp`:
  Compute shader reads original vertex buffer + joint matrices SSBO, writes skinned positions + normals.
  Runs before GBuffer pass. GBuffer pass reads skinned buffer.
  *Commit: `[Phase5/Slice4] GPU skinning compute pass`*

- [ ] **5.5 — Animation blending**
  `src/animation/animator.cpp`: linear 1D blend between two clips (blend weight parameter).
  Additive layer support (per-joint mask bitmask). `BlendTree` struct.
  *Commit: `[Phase5/Slice5] animation blending and additive layers`*

- [ ] **5.6 — Animation state machine**
  `AnimStateMachine`: states, parameterized transitions, crossfade (linear blend during transition duration).
  *Commit: `[Phase5/Slice6] animation state machine with crossfade`*

---

## Phase 6 — Physics

Goal: rigid bodies simulate, a character controller walks on a static mesh collider.

- [ ] **6.1 — Jolt integration**
  `src/physics/physics_world.cpp`: `JPH::PhysicsSystem`, broad/narrow phase, fixed timestep
  accumulator (1/120s), Jolt job system wired to engine thread pool.
  Collision layers: STATIC, DYNAMIC, CHARACTER, TRIGGER.

- [ ] **6.3 — Character controller**
  `src/physics/character.cpp`: `JPH::CharacterVirtual` wrapper.
  `CharacterController` component: move input → velocity, `UpdateCharacter` system.
  Gravity, ground detection, step-up.
  *Commit: `[Phase6/Slice3] character controller`*

- [ ] **6.4 — Trigger / contact callbacks**
  Implement Jolt contact listener. `TriggerEvent` posted to a per-frame event queue.
  Systems can iterate trigger events this frame.
  *Commit: `[Phase6/Slice4] trigger and contact callbacks`*

---

## Phase 7 — Shadows & Lighting Improvements

Goal: directional shadow maps, point lights, basic sky, transparent & glass materials.

- [ ] **7.1 — Cascaded shadow maps**
  `src/renderer/shadow_pass.cpp` + `assets/shaders/shadow.slang`:
  4-cascade CSM for the directional light. Depth-only pass per cascade.
  Sample in lighting pass with PCF.
  *Commit: `[Phase7/Slice1] cascaded shadow maps`*

- [ ] **7.2 — Point lights**
  `PointLight` component. Clustered light list built on CPU, uploaded as SSBO.
  Lighting compute shader samples cluster for the fragment's tile.
  *Commit: `[Phase7/Slice2] clustered point lights`*

- [ ] **7.3 — Procedural sky**
  `assets/shaders/sky.slang`: Preetham/Hillaire analytic sky model.
  Sky pass renders to HDR buffer before transparent pass.
  *Commit: `[Phase7/Slice3] procedural sky`*

- [ ] **7.4 — Forward transparent pass**
  Split scene collection into opaque vs alpha-blended draws. New forward `TransparentPass`
  after the deferred lighting that writes into the HDR buffer, depth-tested against the opaque
  GBuffer depth, reusing the PBR BRDF (factored out of `lighting.slang` into a shared Slang
  module). Back-to-front sorted. Alpha-blend (`BLEND`) and alpha-cutout (`MASK`) materials from
  glTF render correctly.
  *Commit: `[Phase7/Slice4] forward transparent pass`*

- [ ] **7.5 — Glass / transmission (KHR_materials_transmission)**
  Load `KHR_materials_transmission` / `_volume` / `_ior` in the glTF loader. Copy the opaque
  HDR result into a mip-chained scene-colour texture; transmissive surfaces in the transparent
  pass sample it at a refracted screen-space offset (roughness selects the mip, for frosted vs
  clear glass), Fresnel-mix reflection vs refraction, and apply Beer-Lambert volume attenuation
  from thickness. Renders the glass dragon (`DragonAttenuation`) correctly.
  *Commit: `[Phase7/Slice5] glass / transmission`*

---

## Phase 8 — Post-Processing

Goal: TAA, bloom, exposure, final image looks polished.

  Jitter camera per frame (Halton sequence). `assets/shaders/taa.slang`:
  reproject previous frame, history blend, neighbourhood clamp.
  *Commit: `[Phase8/Slice1] temporal anti-aliasing`*

- [ ] **8.2 — Bloom**
  Dual-kawase downsample/upsample chain. Threshold + intensity parameters.
  Composite onto HDR buffer before tonemap.
  *Commit: `[Phase8/Slice2] bloom`*

- [ ] **8.3 — Exposure & auto-exposure**
  Luminance histogram compute pass → exposure value. Lerp toward target EV over time.
  *Commit: `[Phase8/Slice3] exposure and auto-exposure`*

---

## Phase 9 — Editor (ImGui)

Goal: a usable in-engine editor with scene hierarchy, inspector, asset browser, and viewport.

- [ ] **9.1 — ImGui integration**
  `src/renderer/imgui_pass.cpp`: ImGui Vulkan + SDL3 backend. Docking layout.
  Render as final overlay pass. Gated behind `ENGINE_EDITOR` CMake flag.
  *Commit: `[Phase9/Slice1] ImGui integration with docking`*

- [ ] **9.2 — Viewport panel**

  *Commit: `[Phase9/Slice2] editor viewport panel`*

- [ ] **9.3 — Scene hierarchy panel**
  `src/editor/scene_hierarchy.cpp`: tree view of entities (using `Name` + `Parent`/`Children`).
  Click to select. Right-click: create entity, delete entity, duplicate.
  *Commit: `[Phase9/Slice3] scene hierarchy panel`*

- [ ] **9.4 — Inspector panel**
  `src/editor/inspector.cpp`: for selected entity, reflect all attached components via
  `ComponentInspector<T>` template specialisations. Edit Transform, MeshRenderer, lights inline.
  *Commit: `[Phase9/Slice4] inspector panel`*

  *Commit: `[Phase9/Slice6] animation preview panel`*

- [ ] **9.7 — Physics debug draw**
  Implement Jolt `DebugRenderer` interface → emit lines into ImGui draw list.
  Toggle per collision layer. Show contact points.
  *Commit: `[Phase9/Slice7] physics debug draw`*

- [ ] **9.8 — ImGuizmo gizmos**
  Translate/rotate/scale gizmos for selected entity's `Transform` in the viewport.
  Mode toggle in toolbar (W/E/R shortcuts).
  *Commit: `[Phase9/Slice8] ImGuizmo transform gizmos`*

---

## Phase 10 — Async Asset Loading & Hot Reload

Goal: assets stream in without hitches; shader edits reload live.

- [ ] **10.1 — Async asset loading**
  `AssetManager` dispatches loads to the thread pool. `AssetHandle<T>` has `is_ready()`.
  Renderer shows fallback (default white mesh, 1×1 white texture) while loading.
  *Commit: `[Phase10/Slice1] async asset loading`*

- [ ] **10.2 — Shader hot-reload**
  File watcher (inotify on Linux, ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows) detects `.slang` changes.
  Triggers `slangc` recompile, reloads SPIR-V, recreates affected pipelines on next frame.
  *Commit: `[Phase10/Slice2] shader hot-reload`*

- [ ] **10.3 — Asset hot-reload**
  File watcher on `assets/` triggers re-cook + re-upload for changed meshes and textures.
